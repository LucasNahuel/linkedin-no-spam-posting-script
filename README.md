## Overview

### The objective

Users should be able to:

- Block jobs announces from publishers who are not from his interest
- Unblock publishers from job filters panel in order to see again their jobs announces 


### Links

- GreasyFork URL: [GreasyFork script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/472011-not-more-job-spamposting)

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla Javascript
- Tampermonkey [Tampermonkey homepage](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php)

### Continued development

Other than spammy announcers, i also could see the need for filtering announces marked as "Promoted" which some times seems out of place.
Any other recommendations or bugs notification, are welcome through issues tab on github or the feedback tab from greasyFork.
